## Python Developer 🐍

### Hey, I'm Federico Gomez 👋

I'm a **backend developer** from Argentina. 🌎
Currently, I am working at [**Tinkin**](https://www.tinkin.one/) as a full stack developer. 🖥️
I've built many backend applications using FastAPI, Django, and Django Rest Framework.

As a hobby, I started [**Nester**](https://github.com/fedeegmz/nester), a CLI built with Rust that allows you to create
files based on templates. I also created [Beauty Prints](https://github.com/fedeegmz/beauty-prints), a Visual Studio
Code extension that makes debugging easier by inserting print statements with a single command.

Additionally, I developed [youtube-pydantic-models](https://github.com/fedeegmz/youtube-pydantic-models), a Python
library with YouTube models based on Pydantic.

You can find some of my most important projects **pinned** below. 👇👇
